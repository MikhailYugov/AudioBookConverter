Development
--------
Before i wrote this program, i used two free command line programs for this kind of conversion. Faac and madplay. This solution worked fine, but was not very convenient. So I decided to write a simple gui frontend. And MP3 to iPod Audio Book Converter is the result. I released it under the GNU General Public License in hope someone may find it usefull, too.


Enjoy it!
